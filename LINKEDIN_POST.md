# LinkedIn Post Options for Detection Engineering Simulation Dashboard

## Option 1: Problem-Solution Focused (Recommended)

🔐 Excited to share my latest project: a Detection Engineering Simulation Dashboard for my SOC portfolio!

As someone passionate about cybersecurity, I wanted to build something that demonstrates real-world detection engineering skills—not just monitoring, but actually building and tuning detection rules.

**What I Built:**
✅ Simulated 4 real-world attack scenarios (MFA fatigue, impossible travel, OAuth consent abuse, privilege escalation)
✅ Built 8 detection rules mapped to MITRE ATT&CK framework
✅ Created a full-stack dashboard with FastAPI + React showing KPIs, attack timelines, and investigation workflows
✅ Implemented incident response simulation with MTTD/MTTR tracking

**The Challenge:**
I wanted to show how an analyst would investigate an alert from detection to response. So I built investigation drill-downs that let you pivot from a user alert to their full sign-in history, geolocation changes, OAuth consents, and role assignments—just like a real SOC workflow.

**Tech Stack:**
Backend: Python (FastAPI), SQLAlchemy, RESTful APIs
Frontend: React, Recharts, Tailwind CSS
Key Features: Real-time metrics, interactive visualizations, MITRE ATT&CK mapping

The best part? Everything is portfolio-ready and demonstrates both technical skills AND understanding of SOC operations.

Check out the screenshots below to see the dashboard in action! 🚀

What detection engineering projects have you built? Would love to hear about your approach in the comments!

## Option 2: Learning Journey Focused

Just wrapped up building a Detection Engineering Simulation Dashboard, and I'm really proud of how it turned out! 🎯

I've been studying detection engineering and wanted to build a portfolio project that actually shows my understanding—not just another generic security dashboard.

**What makes this different:**
Instead of just displaying alerts, I built a system that:
• Simulates realistic attack scenarios (MFA fatigue, impossible travel, etc.)
• Shows the detection engineering process—from building rules to tuning them
• Demonstrates investigation workflows analysts actually use
• Tracks metrics like MTTD and MTTR that SOC teams care about

**Technical Highlights:**
Built a FastAPI backend with comprehensive data models, created 8 detection rules mapped to MITRE ATT&CK, and developed an interactive React frontend with real-time visualizations.

But more importantly, I learned a ton about:
• How detection rules are structured and documented
• The relationship between security events, alerts, and incidents
• What information analysts need during investigations
• How to map detections to MITRE ATT&CK tactics and techniques

See the screenshots for the full dashboard experience!

This project reinforced how much I enjoy building tools that security teams would actually use. Always open to feedback and would love to connect with others working in detection engineering! 💬

## Option 3: Technical Deep Dive (More Technical)

🚀 New Project: Detection Engineering Simulation Dashboard

I built a full-stack SOC dashboard that simulates identity and cloud attack scenarios, with a focus on detection engineering workflows.

**Architecture:**
• Backend: FastAPI with SQLAlchemy ORM, RESTful API design
• Frontend: React with Recharts for visualizations
• Data Model: 20+ fields covering security events, alerts, incidents, detections

**Detection Rules:**
Built 8 detection rules covering:
- MFA Fatigue (T1110.001)
- Impossible Travel (T1078)
- OAuth Consent Abuse (T1078.004)
- Privilege Escalation (T1078.004)
- Legacy Auth Detection (T1562.001)
- Risky Sign-In Detection (T1078)
- Azure Resource Anomalies (T1496)
- Policy Change Monitoring (T1562.001)

Each detection includes: detection logic, required signals, expected false positives, recommended response, and MITRE ATT&CK mapping.

**Key Features:**
• Executive dashboard with KPIs (MTTD, MTTR, alert trends)
• Attack timeline visualization showing event sequences
• Detection library with engineering documentation
• User investigation drill-down (pivot from alert to full user context)
• Simulated incident response workflow

**Attack Scenarios:**
Generated realistic attack sequences:
- MFA fatigue: 8-15 failed prompts followed by success
- Impossible travel: authentication from distant locations within impossible timeframes
- OAuth abuse: high-risk scope consents
- Privilege escalation: off-hours role assignments

Check out the screenshots! The dashboard is fully interactive and portfolio-ready.

Always happy to discuss detection engineering, SOC workflows, or full-stack security tools! 🤝

## Option 4: Concise & Punchy (Shorter)

🔐 Built a Detection Engineering Simulation Dashboard for my SOC portfolio!

**What it does:**
✅ Simulates 4 real-world attack scenarios
✅ 8 detection rules mapped to MITRE ATT&CK
✅ Full-stack dashboard (FastAPI + React) with KPIs, timelines, and investigation tools
✅ Shows the complete workflow from detection to response

**Why I built it:**
Wanted to demonstrate actual detection engineering skills—building and documenting detection rules, not just displaying alerts. Every detection includes logic, false positive expectations, and response playbooks.

The investigation drill-down feature lets you pivot from an alert to a user's full security context (sign-ins, MFA history, geolocation changes, OAuth consents) just like a real SOC analyst would.

**Tech:** Python (FastAPI), React, SQLAlchemy, Recharts

Check out the screenshots below! 🚀 Always interested in connecting with others working in detection engineering and SOC operations.

## Tips for Posting:

1. **Add screenshots:** Insert screenshots of:
   - Executive Overview page (showing KPIs and charts)
   - Attack Timeline page
   - Detection Library page
   - Investigation Drill-Down
   - Response Actions page

2. **Timing:** Post during business hours (9am-5pm) for better engagement

3. **Engage:** Respond to comments within the first few hours

4. **Hashtags:** Use 3-5 relevant hashtags. Too many looks spammy.

5. **Call to action:** Ask a question to encourage comments

6. **Length:** LinkedIn posts perform best between 150-300 words
