## Option 1: Skills & Achievements Focus (Recommended)

I recently completed a Detection Engineering Simulation Dashboard as part of my SOC portfolio project. This full-stack application demonstrates practical skills in cybersecurity detection engineering and software development.

**Project Overview:**
Built a comprehensive dashboard that simulates identity and cloud attack scenarios, including MFA fatigue, impossible travel, OAuth consent abuse, and privilege escalation attacks. The system includes 8 detection rules mapped to MITRE ATT&CK framework with complete documentation.

**Technical Implementation:**
- Backend: Python with FastAPI, SQLAlchemy ORM, RESTful API design
- Frontend: React with Recharts for data visualization, Tailwind CSS
- Database: SQLite with comprehensive data models covering security events, alerts, incidents, and detections
- Key Features: Real-time KPIs, interactive timelines, investigation drill-downs, simulated incident response workflows

**Detection Engineering Focus:**
Each detection rule includes detection logic, required signals, expected false positives, recommended response actions, and MITRE ATT&CK mapping. The investigation workflow allows analysts to pivot from alerts to full user context including sign-in history, geolocation changes, MFA prompts, OAuth consents, and role assignments.

**Key Metrics Tracked:**
- Mean Time To Detect (MTTD)
- Mean Time To Respond (MTTR)
- Alert trends and patterns
- MITRE ATT&CK tactic distribution
- User investigation workflows

This project showcases both technical development skills and understanding of SOC operations, detection engineering processes, and incident response workflows.

The codebase is portfolio-ready and demonstrates full-stack development capabilities with a security operations focus.

I'm actively seeking opportunities in SOC operations, detection engineering, or security engineering roles where I can apply these skills in a production environment.

Check out the screenshots below to see the dashboard in action.

## Option 2: Problem-Solution Focus

I built a Detection Engineering Simulation Dashboard that solves a common challenge in security operations: demonstrating detection engineering skills beyond just monitoring tools.

**The Challenge:**
Most security portfolios focus on alerts and monitoring, but actual detection engineering requires building and tuning detection rules, understanding false positives, mapping to frameworks like MITRE ATT&CK, and creating investigation workflows that analysts actually use.

**My Solution:**
A full-stack dashboard built with Python (FastAPI) and React that simulates real-world attack scenarios and demonstrates the complete detection engineering lifecycle from rule creation to incident response.

**Technical Stack:**
- Python backend with FastAPI and SQLAlchemy
- React frontend with interactive data visualizations
- Comprehensive data models for security events, alerts, incidents, and detections
- RESTful API design with proper error handling and data serialization

**Key Capabilities:**
- Simulates 4 attack scenarios: MFA fatigue, impossible travel, OAuth consent abuse, privilege escalation
- 8 detection rules with MITRE ATT&CK mappings (Initial Access, Persistence, Privilege Escalation, Defense Evasion)
- Investigation drill-down from alert to full user security context
- Incident response workflow simulation with MTTD and MTTR tracking
- Executive dashboard with KPIs, alert trends, and MITRE tactic analysis

**Detection Engineering Details:**
Each detection includes detection logic in plain English, required signals, expected false positive rates, recommended response actions, and proper MITRE ATT&CK technique mapping. This reflects how detection rules are actually documented in production SOC environments.

The investigation workflow demonstrates understanding of how security analysts pivot from an alert to investigate user behavior, including sign-in patterns, geolocation changes, MFA prompt history, OAuth application consents, and privilege assignments.

This project is portfolio-ready and demonstrates skills relevant to SOC analyst, detection engineer, and security engineering roles.

I'm currently looking for opportunities where I can apply detection engineering and full-stack development skills in a security operations environment.

See the screenshots below for a visual walkthrough of the dashboard.

What detection engineering challenges have you tackled? I'd appreciate any feedback or insights from experienced practitioners.
