# Resume Bullets for Detection Engineering Simulation Dashboard

## Option 1 (Detection Engineering Focus)
**Developed a Detection Engineering Simulation Dashboard** that simulates 4 identity and cloud attack scenarios (MFA fatigue, impossible travel, OAuth consent abuse, privilege escalation) with 8 detection rules mapped to MITRE ATT&CK framework. Built interactive dashboard with 5 pages including executive KPIs, attack timeline visualization, detection library, user investigation drill-down, and simulated incident response workflow. Implemented FastAPI backend with SQLAlchemy ORM and React frontend with Recharts visualizations, tracking MTTD and MTTR metrics.

## Option 2 (SOC Operations Focus)
**Built a SOC Security Operations Dashboard** that visualizes security events, detections, and incident response workflows. Created realistic attack scenario simulations with detection rules covering identity and cloud security threats. Developed comprehensive investigation tools allowing analysts to pivot from alerts to full user investigations, tracking sign-in history, MFA prompts, geolocation changes, OAuth consents, and role assignments. Implemented simulated response actions with incident status tracking and metrics calculation.

## Option 3 (Technical Implementation Focus)
**Designed and implemented a Detection Engineering Dashboard** using FastAPI and React to simulate SOC operations. Created data models for security events with 20+ fields including user, IP, geolocation, MFA results, OAuth scopes, and Azure activities. Built 8 detection rules with MITRE ATT&CK mappings, detection logic, false positive expectations, and response playbooks. Developed RESTful API with filtering, pagination, and drill-down capabilities, and interactive frontend with 5 pages including executive overview, attack timeline, detection library, investigation tools, and response actions.
